# mamba


## Todo:
[] Create a basic cli in rust that will compile to run a command mamba
[] Plan out toml file structure 
[] Figure out virtual env requirements (conda for now)
[] Figure out how to add a new package to file and install using pip 
[] Create preset project structures (for ML which will install pytorch, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib already)
